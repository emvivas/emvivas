My name is Emiliano Vivas Rodríguez and I am a software developer with experience in the design, installation, testing, and maintenance of computational systems. I am currently studying Computational Technology Engineering at Tecnológico de Monterrey campus Mexico City. I studied programming technician degree at CECyTE Morelos campus Emiliano Zapata, I was recognized as the student with the highest academic achievement of my student class 2016 - 2019.

I have professional experience in projects related to youth, science, and technology. From January 2021 to August of that year, I did a student internship at Givaudan De México S.A. de C.V., in this place I worked in the development and maintenance of software for the creation and modification of inventory reports for the production plant in Civac, Jiutepec, Morelos.

I have had experiences beyond the local sphere. From September 2021 to June 2023, I participated in the NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge international competition, where I played the role of leader in the Telemetry area in IKTAN Roving, the Mexican team that obtained first place overall in the competition in 2022, as well as the winner of the NASA Ingenuity Award 2022 - 2023. The position I obtained in this project has allowed me to lead and work as a team in challenging environments.

Similarly, I am enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and business networking fairs where I have participated as a volunteer in INC Monterrey, the largest entrepreneurship fair in Latin America. I am also passionate about scientific learning and dissemination, attending national and international conferences, such as those organized by the Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence. I have collaborated with colleagues in publications of scientific articles and projects that involve artificial intelligence within the field of research and technological innovation. In August 2022, I started to work on the implementation of the Design of Computer Vision Algorithms to Grant Intelligence and Autonomy to Vehicles.

I have been involved in the student government as a member of the Engineering Student Society 2022 - 2023 in Cuernavaca, holding the position of Student Project Management Leader. Added to this, I have signed up for initiatives, such as my participation in the CEA Program, Circle of Student Advisors, 2022 - 2023. Since June 2023, I am part of the XXIV generation of the Diploma in Leadership and Peer Mentoring. This diploma allowed me to prepare myself to carry out projects with a social impact on vulnerable communities.
